# cross-linguistic-eval

sophisticated cross-linguistic evaluation

## why to build this 

### more academic cross-linguistic materials needed for my own research 

- [ ] No specific plans yet

### more cross-linguistic metaphors materials needed 

- [ ] I tend to start with "Metaphors We Live By"

### rising interest in classical China works by my international friends 

- [ ] Maybe from Taozi
